function CGA = GeometricAsianCall(initPrice,K,r,T,sigma,q,numSteps)
%function for evaluating the price of a Geometric Asian Call
%initPrice is the initial price
%K is the strike price
%r is the risk-free interest rate
%T is the time to maturity
%sigma is the volatility
%q is the continuous dividend yield
%numSteps is the number of evaluation steps
%dT is the length of one step
