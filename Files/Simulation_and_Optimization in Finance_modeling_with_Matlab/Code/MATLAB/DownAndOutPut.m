function MCPrice =  DownAndOutPut(initPrice,K,r,T,sigma,q,Sb,numSteps,numPaths)
%function for evaluating the price of a down and out put using
%crude Monte Carlo
%Asset price assumed to follow a geometric random walk
%initPrice is the initial price, K is the strike price
%r is the annual interest rate, T is the time to maturity, sigma is the
%annual volatility
%q is the continuous dividend yield
%Sb is the value for the barrier
%numSteps is the number of steps that constitute a path
%numPaths is the number of scenarios to generate for the evaluation
