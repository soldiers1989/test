function CAA = ArithmeticAsianCallCV(initPrice,K,r,T,sigma,q,numSteps,numPrelim,numPaths)
%function for evaluating the price of an arithmetic Asian option using the price of a geometric %Asian option as a control variate
%initPrice is the initial price, K is the strike price
%r is the annual interest rate, T is the time to maturity, sigma is the
%annual volatility
%q is the continuous dividend yield
%numSteps is the number of evaluation steps between time 0 and maturity
%numPrelim is the number of preliminary trials to run for estimating the coefficient b
%numPaths is the number of scenarios to generate for the actual evaluation of the arithmetic Asian option price.
